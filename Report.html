<h1 class="title toc-ignore">The Squirrel Project</h1>

</div>


<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2><em>Motivation</em></h2>
<p>Squirrels have always served as a needed source of entertainment in Central Park. Other rodents’ population has been</p>
<p>well traced and documented by humans, but not always Squirrels. However, the necessity of mapping the total population</p>
<p>of squirrels in Central Park is observed as it depicts this community’s size and growth, which is highly related to the</p>
<p>evaluation of this community’s functioning as a source of entertainment, as well as their potential of harboring and</p>
<p>delivering pathogens to humans.</p>
<p>In this project, we use The Squirrel Census data from NYC Open Data host, which focuses on Eastern gray species</p>
<p>specifically. For this project, we aim at depicting a full picture of the current squirrels community in Central Park,</p>
<p>with regards to their demographics statistics as well as their living status. We also intend to assess their performance</p>
<p>and activity of Squirrels in Central Park, by evaluating their interactions with humans.</p>
<p>We believe this project can provide evidence-based information for the Central Park Squirrel community, as well as</p>
<p>contribute to better evaluation and regulation of the Squirrel population in Central Park. This project also has the</p>
<p>potential in providing further management insights for the planning and designing aspect of the Central Park.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2><em>Related Work</em></h2>
<p>A recent news article published on The New York Times sheds some light on the motivation behind the two-week long Central</p>
<p>Park Squirrel Census. Despite the ubiquity of the Eastern gray, not much was known about it that we, as humans, should</p>
<p>have figured out from a while ago. The value of such census was not just to delineate a specific behaviour pattern of the</p>
<p>Eastern gray, but to draw a big picture of the squirrels, the park, and us. We were inspired by the behind-scene</p>
<p>motivation of such study and aimed to create this website that has interactive features to learn more about the</p>
<p>distribution of the squirrel population and factors that may affect their behaviour patterns.</p>
<p>We believe such interactive visualization allows squirrel-lovers to pick a place to better spot the squirrels and to allow Central Park’ management team to build a better environment for the squirrel community.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2><em>Initial Questions</em></h2>
<p>In this project, we aimed to examine factors associated with the distribution of the squirrel population in Central Park</p>
<p>as well as factors that may be important in predicting certain squirrel behaviours and squirrel-human/predator</p>
<p>interactions. Our last aim was to predict and visualize different behaviour pattern of the squirrels. We therefore</p>
<p>proposed the following research questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How does squirrel fur color change throughout different hectares in Central park?</p></li>
<li><p>What factors affect squirrel distribution in Central Park? If any association exists, how can we visualize it?</p></li>
<li><p>How can we predict and visualize squirrel’s behaviour and/or their interaction with humans/predators based on ambient environment and temperature?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We downloaded the data from the web and called it <code>hectare</code>.</p>

<div id="tidy-the-dataset" class="section level2">
<h2>Tidy the Dataset</h2>
<p>We created following new variables:</p>
<p><code>temperature_fehrenheit</code> : temperatures for different time during a day.</p>
<p><code>rate</code>: the number of squirrels in each hectare observed by sighters per minute.</p>
<p><code>temperature_category</code> : there are five categories for temperatures, “below 50”, “50-60”, “60-70”, “above 70”, “others”.</p>
<p><code>noninteraction</code>: total squirrels’activity count for running, chasing, climbing, eating and foraging.</p>
<p><code>interaction</code> : total activity count for interaction between squirrels and predators or human, including</p>
<p>kukking, quaaing, tail flags, tail twitching, being indifferent and running away.</p>

<p>During the study period (10/7/2018-10/19/2018), the temperatures’ range is between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit.Below 50</p>
<p>degrees Fahrenheit, the number of squirrels observed drastically declined. Above 50, the change on rate of squirrel</p>
<p>observed is not significant.</p>

<h3>Bubble plot for rate of squirrel observed</h3>
<p>The bubble plot describes how conditions affect the rate of squirrel with different levels of litter amount</p>
<p><img src="Report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="90%" /></p>
<p>The amount of litter and noise levels in the environment did not affect squirrel distribution much; however, when there</p>
<p>was an abundant amount of litters and high level of noise in the environment, the number of squirrels at the lowest.</p>
<p>This partially aligns with our expectations that squirrels stay away from the crowds and occupied areas but why other</p>
<p>levels of litter and noise did not affect the number of squirrels as much worths further investigation.</p>

<h3>Finding</h3>
<p>It is also interesting to see how various factors including temperature, park condition, influence both squirrel’s own</p>
<p>behaviours as well as their interactions with the external environment (including humans and potential predators).</p>
<p>A few limitations of this dataset worth mentioning here. The overall sample size was small making stratified analysis</p>
<p>difficult. We therefore did not perform analysis on specific squirrel activity and could not comment on how the predictors of interest (temperature, condition, ) here will independently affect each activity of interest. In addition, all data</p>
<p>was only collected for 11 days over a period of two consecutive weeks and the temperatures did not vary as much making our conclusion on the association between temperature and squirrel distribution less convincing. A followup problem from this</p>
<p>is that we were not able to make any inference about change in squirrel’s behaviours based on several predictors tested as our samples were limited and were best represent the squirrel population in Central Park. To our knowledge, there was only one other squirrel census conducted previously in Atlanta, our analysis based on data collected in 2018 provides the most</p>
<p>up-to-date information on squirrel behaviors and their interactions with the environment, humans, and other predators. We</p>
<p>therefore believe that our attempt to discover factors associated with squirrel distribution or squirrel behaviours still gave some interesting findings. However, to draw a more definitive conclusion, further investigation on significant predictors of squirrel behaviour patterns should be conducted on wider squirrel populations that span wider geographic areas with longer observation period.</p>

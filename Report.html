<h1 class="title toc-ignore">The Squirrel Project</h1>

</div>


<div id="motivation" class="section level1">
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>Squirrels have always served as a needed source of entertainment in Central Park. Other rodents’ population has been well traced and documented, but not always for the squirrels. However, the necessity of mapping the total population of squirrels in Central Park is observed as it depicts the squirrels’ size and growth. Such information is highly relevant to evaluating the squirrel population as a source of entertainment, as well as their potential of harboring and delivering pathogens to humans.</p>
<p>In this project, we use <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw">The Squirrel Census data</a> from NYC Open Data host, which focuses on Eastern gray species specifically. For this project, we aim at depicting a full picture of the current squirrels community in Central Park, with regards to their demographics statistics as well as their living status. We also intend to assess their performance and activity in Central Park, by evaluating their interactions with humans and potential predators.</p>
<p>We believe this project can provide evidence-based information for the Central Park Squirrel community and contribute to better evaluation and regulation of the Squirrel population in Central Park. This project also has the potential in providing further management insights for the planning and designing aspect of the Central Park.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level1">
<h1>Related Work</h1>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/nyregion/squirrels-central-park.html">recent news article</a> published on The New York Times sheds some light on the motivation behind the two-week long Central Park Squirrel Census. Despite the ubiquity of the Eastern gray, not much was known about it that we, as humans, should have figured out from a while ago. The value of such census was not just to delineate a specific behaviour pattern of the Eastern gray, but to draw a big picture of the squirrels, the park, and us. We were inspired by the behind-scene motivation of such study and aimed to create this website that has interactive features to learn more about the distribution of the squirrel population and factors that may affect their behaviour patterns.</p>
<p>We believe such interactive visualization allows squirrel-lovers to pick a place to better spot the squirrels and to allow Central Park’ management team to build a better environment for the squirrel community.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level1">
<h1>Initial Questions</h1>
<p>In this project, we aimed to examine factors associated with the distribution of the squirrel population in Central Park as well as factors that may be important in predicting certain squirrel behaviours and squirrel-human/predator interactions. Our last aim was to predict and visualize different behaviour pattern of the squirrels. We therefore proposed the following research questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How does squirrel fur color change throughout different hectares in Central park?</p></li>
<li><p>What factors affect squirrel distribution in Central Park? If any association exists, how can we visualize it?</p></li>
<li><p>How does temperature affect the number of squirrels observed?</p></li>
<li><p>How can we predict and visualize squirrel’s behaviour and/or their interaction with humans/predators based on ambient environment and temperature?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h1>Exploratory analysis</h1>
<div id="load-in-dataset" class="section level3">
<h3>Load in Dataset</h3>
<p>We downloaded the data from the web and called them <code>squirrel</code> and <code>hectare</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="explore-the-dataset" class="section level3">
<h3>Explore the Dataset</h3>
<p>There are three types of fur colors for squirrels observed in the park, and the table shows the number of adult and juvenile squirrels with different fur colors. There are 158 squirrels lacking information on fur colors.</p>

<p>For easier analysis on the two datasets, we created following new variables:</p>
<p><code>temperature_fehrenheit</code> : temperatures for different time during a day.</p>
<p><code>rate</code>: the number of squirrels in each hectare observed by sighters per minute.</p>
<p><code>temperature_category</code> : there are five categories for temperatures, “below 50”, “50-60”, “60-70”, “above 70”, “others”.</p>
<p><code>noninteraction</code>: total squirrels’activity count for running, chasing, climbing, eating and foraging.</p>
<p><code>interaction</code> : total activity count for interaction between squirrels and predators or human, including kukking, quaasing, tail flags, tail twitching, being indifferent and running away.</p>

<p>During the study period (10/7/2018-10/19/2018), the temperatures’ range is between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit.Below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, the number of squirrels observed drastically declined. Above 50, the change on rate of squirrel observed is not significant.</p>

<h4>Bubble plot for rate of squirrel observed</h4>
<p>The bubble plot describes how conditions affect the rate of squirrel with different levels of litter amount</p>
<p><img src="Report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="90%" /></p>
<p>The amount of litter and noise levels in the environment did not affect squirrel distribution much; however, when there was an abundant amount of litters and high level of noise in the environment, the number of squirrels at the lowest.</p>
<p>This partially aligns with our expectations that squirrels stay away from the crowds and occupied areas but why other levels of litter and noise did not affect the number of squirrels as much worths further investigation.</p>

<h1>Statistical Analysis</h1>
<p>From the boxplot and bubble plot above we can roughly see the relationship between the rate of squirrel observed and temperature, litter and hectare conditions. After filtering the missing values in “litter” and “hectare_conditions”, we fit a linear regression model to formally test for these associations.</p>

<p>Different from the boxplot, instead of <code>temperature category</code>, we use the continuous variable <code>temperature_fahrenheit</code> in the model because we want to make full use of the dataset and increase the power of the hypothesis test. Consistent with the boxplot above, we have enough evidence to claim that there would be more squirrels observed when temperature is higher, at 5% level of significance.</p>
<p>The negative estimates of <code>litterAbundant</code> and <code>hectare_conditionsBusy</code> indicate that when litter is abundant and there is a high level of noise in the hectare, there will be least squirrels observed within every sighting time unit, which is also consistent with the visualization above. However, the amount of litter and level of noise are not significantly associated with rate of squirrel observed, which may be due to small sample size and the presence of missing values.</p>

<div id="discussion" class="section level1">
<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>It is interesting to see how various factors including temperature, park condition, influence both squirrel’s own behaviours as well as their interactions with the external environment (including humans and potential predators).</p>
<p>A few limitations of this dataset worth mentioning here. The overall sample size was small making stratified analysis difficult. We therefore did not perform analysis on specific squirrel activity and could not comment on how the predictors of interest (temperature, condition) here will independently affect each activity of interest. In addition, all data was only collected for 11 days over a period of two consecutive weeks and the temperatures did not vary as much making our conclusion on the association between temperature and squirrel distribution less convincing. A followup problem from this is that we were not able to make any inference about change in squirrel’s behaviours based on several predictors tested as our samples were limited and were best represent the squirrel population in Central Park. To our knowledge, there was only one other squirrel census conducted previously in Atlanta, our analysis based on data collected in 2018 provides the most up-to-date information on squirrel behaviors and their interactions with the environment, humans, and other predators. We therefore believe that our attempt to discover factors associated with squirrel distribution or squirrel behaviours still gave some interesting findings. However, to draw a more definitive conclusion, further investigation on significant predictors of squirrel behaviour patterns should be conducted on wider squirrel populations that span wider geographic areas with longer observation period.</p>

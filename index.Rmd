"Observing animal behavior at close range may affect the way people think about the environment around them." 
- *Colin Jerolmack, Chairman of New York University’s Department of Environmental Studies*

"The wonders of the Eastern gray squirrel have yet to be plumbed, despite — or maybe because of — its ubiquity.There’s not a lot of squirrel data out there.
